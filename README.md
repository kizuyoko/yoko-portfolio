# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi! This is Yoko, a Frontend Developer.

This portfolio is currently being rebuilt from scratch to reflect my recent growth in modern frontend technologies such as React, Next.js, and TypeScript.  

You can still view my previous portfolio [here](https://portfolioyoko.vercel.app) to see how far I’ve come.

Feel free to explore my updated work — and check back soon for further improvements!

This page is made by my [Boilerplate](https://boilerplate-react-nextjs-typescript.vercel.app/). Feel free to clone and use it!
