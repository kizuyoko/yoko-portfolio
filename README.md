# Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi! This is Yoko, a Frontend Developer.

This portfolio site has been completely rebuilt from scratch to reflect my recent growth in modern frontend technologies including React, Next.js, and TypeScript.  

You can still view my previous portfolio [here](https://portfolioyoko.vercel.app) to see how far I’ve come.

Feel free to explore my updated work — and check back soon for further improvements!

This site was created using my custom [boilerplate](https://boilerplate-react-nextjs-typescript.vercel.app/). You're welcome to clone it and use it as a starting point for your own projects!

## Improvements from the last version
- Design from scratch with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/jawKCOfRFJjaRytr5RtJDm/Yoko-Portfolio?node-id=63-38&t=e8XsOdkiLwFETs5y-1)
- Improved page structure with Next.js routing and better performance
- Categorized skills section for easier readability
- Project section with more detailed descriptions
- More complex responsive design, now that the number of pages has increased
- Documentation in README.md and feature branches per pages while development
